This code is software writen by me and my group to pass the second semester at the UCN. The code is now old and it is no longer supported by a group.
Requierements for the project was to use Java as code language, SQL Server Management Studio as a database platform and Java swing library to build GUI.
Java swing is litle bit outdated technology in order of graphical features so, the project's GUI is not the most modern one.
Now the project serves just as a showcase of a java code knowledge and a software architecture knowledge.
Project has many lines of the code and it is supported by a report and documentation which you check out in the folder.
